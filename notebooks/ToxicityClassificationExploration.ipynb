Furthermore, we cannot stress enough that this is by no means personal. The general attendance rate is low, due to multiple incremental factors like students having to work to support themselves, regardless of the course in question and if attendance is mandatory or not. We would also like to note that last week was midterms week with overlapping deadlines and that we don’t have a rich mathematical background like the students of MIPT, due to the industrial/practical nature of most courses at Innopolis; so, sometimes it is wiser to skip lecture and dedicate more time to go over not only lecture materials but necessary prerequisites to fill our knowledge gaps. It’s also important to note that if this course wasn’t important to us, there wouldn’t be that many students signing up for it (this is double the usual amount). We’re just doing the best we can with the starting state we were in and with the other workload of university/life.\",\n",
